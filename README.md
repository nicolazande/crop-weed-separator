## Description

The aim of this project is to leverage a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for an image segmentation task, focusing on the separation of weeds from crops. By employing image segmentation, the objective is to automate the process of identifying and distinguishing between weeds and crops in agricultural fields.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of annotated images, where each pixel is labeled as either "weed" or "crop". The availability of a well-annotated dataset is crucial for training a successful segmentation model that can accurately segment the regions of interest. The full dataset can be found here: `https://zenodo.org/records/8102217`.
